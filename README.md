## :bulb: Idea For The Project :grinning:
 A big thanks :gift_heart: to React official website's [Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) on how to build a `tic-tac-toe` game.

## :sparkles: Features :nerd_face:
This project, although created with the help of tutorial, contains some extended features: 
* Minimalistic **dark mode UI**
* **Live displaying of player scores**, for both `player x` and `player o`
* **Coloured boxes** to represent the winning combination of squares, in case a player wins
* `undo`, `restart`, `reset` features available
    - `undo` helps **revert the moves** as and when required
    - `restart` **refreshes board** for players to play next match
    - `reset` **erases all data** including player live scores

## :rocket: Deployment :grin:
The full project is deployed on [github pages](https://soumyajit0803.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)!
